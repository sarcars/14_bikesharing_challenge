# 14_bikesharing_challenge
Module 14 Tableau Challenge


## Project Overview 

After using a bike share program (Citibike) in New York City, we are interested in seeing if a similar program would be feasible in Des Moines, Iowa.  Using data from Citibike usage in New York City, we were tasked with creating visualizations to show various breakdowns of the New York City Citibike data.

## Results

### Tableau Dashboard
The Tableau Story created for this challenge via Tableau Public is available here

### Minutes bikes were checked out

This graph shows the number of minutes bikes were checked out, segmented by hours.  The usage peaks at 5 minutes, with most bikes being used for less than 30 minutes




### Checkout Times by Gender

When the same minutes of usage data is broken down further, we can see that the majority of users for any length of time are male with both male and female strongest usage at about 5 minutes.





### Trips by Day of the Week for Each Hour

In this heatmap we can see both the days and times of those days that see the highest usage.  There is a shift in time used on the weekends (Saturday and Sunday) but during the week, morning hours between 7:00 and 10:00 a.m. and evening hours between 5:00 and 8:00 p.m. saw the highest usage





### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

Breaking this same data down further into usage by gender we see the same trends for both Male and Female riders.




### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

When we look at the data for usage by day for the two user types of `customer` and `subscriber`.  We can see that `customers` are more likely to use the service on weekends (Saturday and Sunday) whereas `subscribers` use the service more during the week, with a peak on Thursdays.




### Bike Utilization
![Bike Utilization by Bike ID](/images/BikeUtilization.png)

This bubble chart shows the number of seconds each bike (by bike id) was used.  This shows that some bikes are used more often than others and would likely need more frequent upkeep.





### Top Starting and Stopping Locations

This map shows the starting and stopping locations for the bikes in New York City.  In general, the more popular starting locations are also the more popular stopping locations.




## Summary

The visualizations provided show the Citibike bike usage for New York City showing trends for time and days the bikes are in use.  This data shows us that in New York City bikes are being used for relatively short trips before and after normal working hours.  Additional visualizations that could be created using this data would be to look at the usage by age of the user both for length of trips (duration) and for days and times different ages use the service.  This would allow targeted marketing to various demographics.
